--- This is a Python program to create a linked list and display its elements.

#Problem Description

The program creates a linked list using data items input from the user and displays it.

#Problem Solution

1. Create a class Node with instance variables data and next.
2. Create a class LinkedList with instance variables head and last_node.
3. The variable head points to the first element in the linked list while last_node points to the last.
4. Define methods append and display inside the class LinkedList to append data and display the linked list respectively.
5. Create an instance of LinkedList, append data to it and display the list.

#Program/Source Code

# Here is the source code of a Python program to create a linked list and display its elements. The program output is shown below.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
       self.data = data
       self.next = None
 
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.last_node = None
 
    def append(self, data):
        if self.last_node is None:
            self.head = Node(data)
            self.last_node = self.head
        else:
            self.last_node.next = Node(data)
            self.last_node = self.last_node.next
 
    def display(self):
        current = self.head
        while current is not None:
            print(current.data, end = ' ')
            current = current.next
            
#Main Function 

a_llist = LinkedList()
n = int(input('How many elements would you like to add? '))
for i in range(n):
    data = int(input('Enter data item: '))
    a_llist.append(data)
print('The linked list: ', end = '')
a_llist.display()


#Program Explanation

1. An instance of LinkedList is created.
2. The user is asked for the number of elements they would like to add. This is stored in n.
3. Using a loop, data from the user is appended to the linked list n times.
4. The linked list is displayed.


#Runtime Test Cases

Case 1:
How many elements would you like to add? 5
Enter data item: 3
Enter data item: -2
Enter data item: 1
Enter data item: 5
Enter data item: 0
The linked list: 3 -2 1 5 0 
 
Case 2:
How many elements would you like to add? 1
Enter data item: 6
The linked list: 6 
 
Case 3:
How many elements would you like to add? 4
Enter data item: 2
Enter data item: 9
Enter data item: 3
Enter data item: 2
The linked list: 2 9 3 2
